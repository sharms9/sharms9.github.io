title: Hello World!
---
Hello dear world!  Welcome to my abode as I take you along my journeys and discoveries.  Let me tell you about my first week at Bootcamp.  The good thing is that I made it through and am sitting here writing this.  It was like being thrown into the deep end of a swimming pool and not knowing how to swim!!!  I managed to tred water but I want to be an Olympic gold medalist swimmer.  I will get there.  My first assignment post project was to create a blog and say hello to you all, and I DID IT!!!!!  Little accomplishments like this go a long way in training to be a gold medalist.  So join me on this journey for the next 11 weeks.  May you find peace and love within and may the force be with you!!
