Want to try to predict the future?  Try time series analysis!  Often used in statistics, econometrics, quantitative finance, seismology, meterology and gephysics.  In signal processing and communication engineering time series analysis is used for signal detection and estimation.  Applications in data mining include pattern recognition and in machine learning it is used for clustering, classification, query by content, anomaly detection as well as forecasting.  Time series forecasting is the process of using a model to predict a future
value based off of previous observations
